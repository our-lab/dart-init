##### My current path/resource for learning dart
---
## High Priority TODOs:

######  I think maybe fastest way to have overlook on Dart would be this [codelab overview page](https://dart.dev/codelabs)

*Let explore below path:*
1. Get all high level syntax constructs(not basic)[Dart Cheet Sheet](https://dart.dev/codelabs/dart-cheatsheet)
2. High level overview of [Iteratable Collections](https://dart.dev/codelabs/iterables)
3. Read [Dart type system](https://dart.dev/guides/language/type-system) to understanding use of generics in dart
4. Overview of [asnc programming](https://dart.dev/codelabs/async-await)
5. Overview of [Null safety codelab](https://dart.dev/codelabs/null-safety) in practice.
6. Read about constructors from Dart Tour.
7. Basic [dart syntax](https://dart.dev/samples), only need skimming to check out unknown syntax.

#### TODO:
1. Chaining method calls;  a..b = true..c = 5;  Cascade used for chaining access to methods and other members. Equivalent: a.b = true; a.c = 5
2. Learn casting techniques in Dart.
3.
