##### My current path/resource for learning dart

## High Priority TODOs:

######  I think maybe fastest way to have overlook on Dart would be this [codelab overview page](https://dart.dev/codelabs)

Ongoing Todo:
---
- [ ] Basic [dart syntax](https://dart.dev/samples), only need skimming to check out unknown syntax.

Additional/Misc:
noSuchMethod override
- [ ] [extension methods](https://dart.dev/guides/language/extension-methods)
- [ ] [Async programming with Stream](https://dart.dev/tutorials/language/streams)
- [ ] [Json handling](https://dart.dev/guides/json)
- [ ] Chaining method calls;  a..b = true..c = 5;  Cascade used for chaining access to methods and other members. Equivalent: a.b = true; a.c = 5
- [ ] Learn casting techniques in Dart.
- [ ] [understanding streams controller](https://dart.dev/articles/libraries/creating-streams)

## lower priority/Priority yet to decide:

- [ ] Dart Language Overview: [Tour](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour)
- [ ] [A comprehensive guide](https://dart.dev/null-safety/understanding-null-safety#top-and-bottom) to understand null
  safety
- [ ] [Continue reading](https://dart.dev/null-safety/understanding-null-safety#never-for-unreachable-code) null safety
  from link
- [ ] Learn how to [diagnose dart error messages](https://dart.dev/tools/diagnostic-messages#glossary)
-[ ] [Testing in Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/testing)
-[ ] Read this if you see such code [Extension method](https://dart.dev/guides/language/extension-methods)
